\begin{itemize}
\item Statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google
\item Go uses a syntax similar to C
\item It provides a garbage collector, reflection, and some other high-level language capabilities.
\item The Go binary has the cross-compilation feature natively.
\item Go supports the object-oriented programming paradigm, but it does not have type inheritance
\item In Go, the definition of a type (``class") is done by means of separate declarations (interfaces, structs, embedded values).
\item Go allows the use of delegation (via embedded values) and polymorphism (via interfaces).
\item Go can implement concurrency through the goroutines.
\item Go is designed to take advantage of systems with multiple processors and network processing.
\item Go supports dynamic data typing also known as duck typing.
\item A struct can implement an interface automatically.
